# Path finder algorithm

This project is a specialized tool designed to gather data along predefined paths, such as walking routes or navigation trails. This tool is particularly useful for scenarios where sequential data collection is required, such as tracking letters along a specified path.

# How It Works:

1.Initialization: The data collection process begins at a designated starting point marked by the character >.
2.Path Following: The tool follows a predetermined path of characters, navigating through the sequence according to the specified route.
3.Letter Collection: Along the path, the tool collects capital letters encountered, storing them for further processing.
4.Termination: Data collection halts upon reaching the character s, signifying the end of the path.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   git clone https://github.com/alban9999/pathFinderAlgorithm
   This command will download the project files to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   cd pathFinderAlgorithm
   Move into the project's root directory to proceed with the setup.

3. **Compile the TypeScript code:**
   npx tsc
   This command compiles the TypeScript code into JavaScript, preparing it for execution.

4. **Once the code is compiled, you can run the application with the following command:**
   node main.js
   This command executes the main JavaScript file, initiating the path-finding algorithm.

## Requirements

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine before proceeding. If you haven't installed them yet, you can download and install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
